To compile JavaPayload for Metasploit (including Java Meterpreter), you need
Maven 3.0 or above. Just run

```
mvn package
```

to package all the files, or

```
mvn -P deploy package
```

to package all the files and copy them into the correct place for Metasploit
(`../metasploit-framework/data/java`). If you get spurious compilation errors,
make sure that there is an exclude rule in your antivirus for the Metasploit
directory (or that your antivirus is disabled).

If the path to your metasploit framework repository is not `../../metasploit-framework`,
but for example `../msf3`, use

```
mvn -D deploy.path=../msf3 -P deploy package
```

In case you want to edit/debug JavaPayload for Metasploit or Java Meterpreter,
Maven provides plugins to auto-generate project files for your favourite IDE
(at least for Eclipse, Netbeans or IntelliJ). I use Eclipse, so to generate
project files I use

```
mvn eclipse:eclipse
```

This will generate project files that can be imported via

**File->Import->Existing Projects into Workspace**

into your Eclipse workspace.

(Note that if this is your first Maven project you want to use in Eclipse, you
also have to run

```
mvn -Declipse.workspace=/path/to/your/workspace eclipse:configure-workspace
```

to set up path variables like `M2_REPO` to point to the correct location.)

For NetBeans or IntelliJ IDEA, refer to the documentation at

http://maven.apache.org/netbeans-module.html
http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-idea-plugin/

## Android

1. Download the [Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html), and the [Android NDK](https://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/index.html) somewhere
2. Launch the `sdk/tool/android` program
3. Install API version 10 and API version 3, then update the "Android SDK Tools" and "Android SDK Platform-tools"
4. Compile android meterpreter:

```
mvn package -Dandroid.sdk.path=/path/to/android-sdk -Dandroid.ndk.path=/path/to/android-ndk -Dandroid.release=true -P deploy
```
